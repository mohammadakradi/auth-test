A silver kite drifted through the lavender sky, trailing tiny echoes of yesterday's laughter.
Cobbled shadows whispered secrets to the lamplight as the city hummed in quiet agreement.
A teaspoon of stardust melted into the morning tea, sweetening the memory of rain.
Footsteps on the old bridge kept time with a distant accordion, stubbornly cheerful.
The mailbox bloomed overnight with postcards from places that only exist on rainy afternoons.
Somewhere behind the bakery, a clock decided to skip one minute and the world forgave it.
